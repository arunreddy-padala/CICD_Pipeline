# CodeFlow_Orchestrator_CICD_Pipeline

This Jenkins pipeline automates the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow for a Java application. Using a robust suite of tools including Spring Boot, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, SonarQube, and Argo CD, the pipeline enhances the development lifecycle from code commit to production deployment on AWS EC2.

Languages & Frameworks: Java, Spring Boot, Maven, AWS EC2, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, SonarQube, Argo CD

Pipeline Setup and Execution:
- Jenkins Plugins: Configured with essential plugins such as Git, Maven Integration, Pipeline, and Kubernetes Continuous Deploy to manage the pipeline's functionality.
- Repository and Pipeline Configuration: Linked Jenkins to the Git repository containing the Java application and a Jenkinsfile which outlines the pipeline stages.
  
Pipeline Stages:
- Code Checkout: Automatically checks out the source code from the Git repository.
- Build: Compiles the Java application using Maven.
- Testing: Executes unit tests utilizing JUnit and Mockito frameworks.
- Quality Analysis: Conducts a SonarQube analysis to ensure code quality standards.
- Packaging: Packages the application into a JAR file.
- Deployment: Deploys the application into a production environment managed by Argo CD.

Kubernetes and Argo CD Integration:
- Kubernetes Setup: Utilizes Kubernetes for orchestrating Docker containers, ensuring scalable and manageable application deployment.
- Argo CD Configuration: Argo CD is installed on the Kubernetes cluster to continuously deliver the application from Git to Kubernetes, tracking changes in real-time.

Monitoring and Management
- CI/CD Monitoring: The Jenkins dashboard provides real-time feedback on the pipeline status, allowing quick identification and resolution of any issues during the build or deployment stages.
- Security and Compliance: Integrates security scans and compliance checks into the pipeline to maintain robust security postures.
